## Characters and Plot Notes
### Cast

_Jim Jenkins_: Chief Photocopy Officer for a dying newspaper house, the Chicago Tribune. He is unimpressive and underwhelming.

_Lost Alice_: amoral techpunk hacker that does it for the lulz, responsible for the first hacking but is she responsible for all of it? DUN DUN DUNNnnNNNnn.

_Mike Dyson_: The maniacal heir to the Dyson fortune, probably the bad guy because he had one of those quintessential Bad Guy laughs. Maybe.
